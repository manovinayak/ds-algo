## Set: Has Unique Chars ( ** Interview Question)

Your task is to write a function named hasUniqueChars that takes a string as input. Your function should check if all the characters in the string are unique or not. In other words, no character should appear more than once in the string.

Example

- Input: "hello"
- Output: false

In this example, the letter 'l' appears two times in the word "hello". So, the function should return false.

Example

- Input: "world"
- Output: true

In this example, all the letters are unique, so the function should return true.

Requirements

- Your function should take a string as an input.
- The function should return a Boolean value: true if all characters are unique, and false otherwise.

Notes

- The function should consider upper-case and lower-case letters as different. For example, 'A' and 'a' should be considered unique.
- An empty string should return true as it doesn't have any repeated characters.
