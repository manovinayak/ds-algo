## Set: Remove Duplicates

Your task is to write a function called removeDuplicates that takes a list of numbers or letters as input.

This list can have some items that appear more than once.
Your function should return a new list where each number or letter only appears once.

Example

- Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]
- Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

In this example, the numbers 2 and 4 appear more than once in the list. The function removes the extra copies, so each number only appears one time.

Requirements

1. The function should take a list as an input.
2. The function should return a new list.
3. Each item in the new list should only appear once.

Notes

- The order of items in the output list does not matter.
- It's okay if your function changes the order of the items.
- You can assume the list only contains numbers or letters.
